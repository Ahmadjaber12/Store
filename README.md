This project is an E-commerce store ,the user can register , login and purchase an items from the listed products.
I used React & Typescript for a profissional UI and for simple movement between the pages,the user can filter for any type of products and search for any of them.
In the backend , I used ASP.Net and some libraries in it like Identity,JWTBearer and Entity framework for a better handle in the Database.
Also there is an online payment method using Stripe.
